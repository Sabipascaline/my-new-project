 Project Title: "MindMate AI: A Context-Aware Chatbot for Youth Mental Health Support"
Final project for the Building AI course 
## Project Summary:

MindMate AI is a conversational AI chatbot designed to provide basic emotional support and wellness guidance to users experiencing stress, anxiety, or low moods. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis, the chatbot detects emotional tone in user inputs and responds with empathetic, non-clinical support messages.

This prototype targets youth in underserved communities where access to mental health professionals is limited. It demonstrates how AI can be ethically and responsibly used to complement human support, not replace it.

## Key Objectives:

*Use AI to detect emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative) in user messages.
*Respond with supportive, context-aware responses.
*Provide mental wellness prompts like breathing exercises or calming words.
*Serve as a safe, stigma-free space for self-expression and basic emotional aid.

### Project Objective:

To build a prototype AI-powered chatbot that provides: non-clinical emotional support and mental wellness resources to users, using Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and machine learning classification techniques.

---

###  AI Techniques Used:

1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**

   * To interpret user inputs, intents, and emotional states.
   * Tools: spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, or OpenAI’s GPT (if available).

2. **Sentiment Analysis**

   * Classify user input as positive, neutral, or negative, and detect emotional tone (e.g., sadness, stress, anxiety).
   * Tools: `TextBlob`, `VADER`, or fine-tuned BERT models.

3. **Text Classification**

   * ML model trained on labeled text data to identify if the user is asking for:

     * Emotional support
     * Stress coping tools
     * Crisis help
     * General wellness info

4. **Conversational Agent / Rule-based logic**

   * To respond contextually based on the classified category or sentiment.
   * Can use Rasa or a Flask-based chatbot with custom logic.

5. **Crisis Detection (Optional Advanced)**

   * Use keyword spotting + ML to detect red-flag language indicating risk of self-harm or severe distress.

---

###  Dataset Ideas:

* **Emotion classification datasets** (e.g., Emotion Dataset on Hugging Face)
* **Mental health forum data** (e.g., Reddit Mental Health datasets)
* You can also simulate your own small labeled dataset for training and evaluation.

---

###  Key Features of the App (Prototype):

* User enters a message (e.g., "I feel overwhelmed and can’t sleep lately.")
* AI model:

  * Extracts emotional tone (negative/stressed)
  * Classifies intent as “support request”
  * Responds with: “I’m here for you. Want to try a quick breathing exercise?”
* System logs conversation and tracks emotion trends.

---

###  Tools You Can Use:

* Python (main language)
* Flask or Streamlit (for interface)
* TensorFlow or Scikit-learn (for models)
* Hugging Face Transformers (for language models)
* SQLite (for logging conversations, optional)

---

###  Evaluation:

* Model accuracy for intent classification and sentiment detection
* User experience simulation with scripted dialogues
* Ethical considerations: ensuring responses are neutral, safe, and non-judgmental

Here's a simple prototype of "MindMate AI" chatbot in action! It analyzes user input for sentiment and responds accordingly:


### Example Conversations:

1. User: "I feel really sad and anxious today."
   Bot: "I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise or talk more about it?"

2. User: "I'm doing okay, just tired."
   Bot: "Thanks for sharing. I'm here if you'd like to chat more or explore a calming exercise."

3. User: "I'm so excited about my new project!"
   Bot: "That's great to hear! Keep holding onto those positive vibes."
